📱 Responsive Design: Beautiful, mobile-friendly interface
⚡ Fast & Scalable: Optimized for performance on Avalanche network
🏗️ AVALANCHE TECH USED:
Blockchain & Security

✅ Smart Contracts on Avalanche C-Chain using Solidity via Remix AI.

✅ Dual login: WalletConnect + Voter ID / PAN / Aadhaar verification.

✅ Zero-knowledge proof (ZK): Ensures anonymous vote verification.

✅ Proof of Vote NFT: Users get a proof NFT for participation (no vote data exposed).

Transparency / Audit

✅ Public audit page: Displays election smart contract address, transaction hashes, and block explorer links.

✅ Immutable results: All votes recorded on Avalanche, cannot be tampered.

Scalability & Future Vision

🔹 Cross-chain ready: Avalanche → Polygon → Ethereum (future expansion).

Accessibility & UX

🌐 Multi-language UI: English, Hindi, and more.

🎤 Voice input support for casting votes.

📱 Mobile-first design with simple, intuitive interface.

🔊 Text-to-speech support for accessibility.
